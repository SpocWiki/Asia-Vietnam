> The **Ho Chi Minh trail** (Vietnamese: Đường mòn Hồ Chí Minh), 
> also called Annamite Range Trail (Vietnamese: Đường Trường Sơn) 
> was a logistical network of roads and trails that ran from North Vietnam 
> to South Vietnam through the kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia. 
> The system provided support, in the form of manpower and materiel, 
> to the Viet Cong (or "VC") and the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), 
> during the Vietnam War. 
> 
> Construction for the network began 
> following the North Vietnamese invasion of Laos in July 1959.  
> At the time it was believed to be the main supply route, 
> however it later transpired that the Sihanouk Trail 
> which ran through Cambodia was handling significantly more material.
>
> It was named by the U.S. after the North Vietnamese leader Hồ Chí Minh. 
> The origin of the name is presumed to have come from the First Indochina War, 
> when there was a Viet Minh maritime logistics line 
> called the "Route of Ho Chi Minh", and shortly after late 1960, 
> as the present trail developed, Agence France-Presse (AFP) announced 
> that a north–south trail had opened, and they named the corridor La Piste de Hồ Chí Minh, the 'Hồ Chí Minh Trail'. 
> 
> The trail ran mostly in Laos, and was called the Trường Sơn Strategic Supply Route 
> (Đường Trường Sơn) by the communists, after the Vietnamese name for 
> the Annamite Range, a major mountain range of central Vietnam. 
> 
> They further identified the trail as either West Trường Sơn (Laos) 
> or East Trường Sơn (Vietnam). 
> 
> According to the U.S. National Security Agency's official history of the war, 
> the trail system was 
> "one of the great achievements of military engineering of the 20th century". 
> 
> The trail was able to effectively supply troops fighting in the south, 
> an unparalleled military feat, 
> given it was the site of the single most intense air interdiction campaign in history.
