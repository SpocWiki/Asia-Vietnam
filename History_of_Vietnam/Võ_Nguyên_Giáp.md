> Võ Nguyên Giáp (chữ Hán: 武元甲, Vietnamese pronunciation: [vɔ̌ˀ ŋʷīən jǎːp]; 
> 25 August 1911 – 4 October 2013) 
> was a Vietnamese general, communist revolutionary and politician. 
> 
> Highly regarded as a military strategist, 
> Giáp led Vietnamese communist military forces to victory 
> in the decades long Indochina wars. 
> 
> Giáp was the military commander of the Việt Minh and the People's Army 
> from 1941 to 1972, minister of defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam 
> (North Vietnam) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1946–1947 
> and from 1948 to 1980, and deputy prime minister from 1955 to 1991. 
> He was a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam.
>
> Born in Quảng Bình province to an affluent peasant family, 
> Giáp began participating in anti-colonial political activity in 1925. 
> 
> Sources conflict as to whether he joined the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, 
> or not until 1940. 
> 
> Giáp rose to prominence during World War II 
> as the military leader of the Việt Minh resistance against the Japanese occupation, 
> and after the war led anti-colonial forces 
> in the First Indochina War against the French. 
> 
> He won a decisive victory at the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which ended the war. 
> 
> In the Vietnam War, Giáp led the PAVN against South Vietnam and the United States. Giáp was commander of the army during the 1968 Tet Offensive and 1972 Easter Offensive, after which he was succeeded by Văn Tiến Dũng, but remained defense minister through the U.S. withdrawal and final victory against South Vietnam in 1975. Giáp oversaw his final campaigns in the successful Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978 and the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War. He resigned as defense minister in 1980 and left the Politburo in 1982. Giáp remained on the Central Committee and as deputy prime minister until 1991, and died in 2013 at age 102.
>
> Giáp is regarded as a great military leader. 
> During the First Indochina War, he transformed a disorganized band of rebels 
> to a "fine light-infantry army" fielding cryptography, artillery 
> and advanced logistics capable of 
> challenging the larger, modernised French Far East Expeditionary Corps 
> and Vietnamese National Army. 
> 
> Giáp, who in the 1930s had studied law and worked as a history teacher, 
> had never received any military training prior to World War II. 
> 
> A highly effective logistician, he was the principal architect of the [[Ho_Chi_Minh_Trail]], 
> the logistical network from North to South Vietnam, 
> through the kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, 
> which is recognised as one of the 20th century's great feats of military engineering. 
>
> Giáp is often credited with 
> North Vietnam's military victory over the United States and South Vietnam. 
> 
> Recent scholarship cites other leaders as more prominent, 
> with former subordinates and later rivals Dũng and Hoàng Văn Thái 
> later having a more direct military responsibility. 
> 
> Nevertheless, he was crucial to the transformation of the PAVN 
> into "one of the largest, most formidable" mechanised 
> and combined-arms fighting force capable of 
> defeating the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in conventional warfare.
