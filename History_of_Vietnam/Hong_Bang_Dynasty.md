> The Hồng Bàng period (Vietnamese: thời kỳ Hồng Bàng), also called the Hồng Bàng dynasty, 
> was a legendary ancient period in Vietnamese historiography, 
> spanning from the beginning of the rule of Kinh Dương Vương 
> over the kingdom of Văn Lang (initially called Xích Quỷ) in 2879 BC 
> until the conquest of the state by An Dương Vương in 258 BC. 
> Vietnamese history textbooks claim that this state was established in the 7th century BC 
> on the basis of the Dong Son culture.

> The 15th-century Vietnamese chronicle Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư (Đại Việt, The Complete History) claimed that the period began with Kinh Dương Vương as the first Hùng king (Vietnamese: Hùng Vương or Vua Hùng), a title used in many modern discussions of the ancient Vietnamese rulers of this period. The Hùng king was the absolute monarch of the country and, at least in theory, wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư also recorded that the nation's capital was Phong Châu (in present-day Phú Thọ Province in northern Vietnam) and alleged that Văn Lang was bordered to the west by Ba-Shu (present-day Sichuan), to the north by Dongting Lake (Hunan), to the east by the South China Sea and to the south by Champa.
