> The Trần dynasty (Vietnamese: Nhà Trần, chữ Nôm: 茹陳; Vietnamese: triều Trần, 
> chữ Hán: 朝陳), officially Đại Việt (Chữ Hán: 大越), 
> was a Vietnamese dynasty that ruled from 1225 to 1400. 
> 
> The dynasty was founded when emperor Trần Thái Tông ascended to the throne after his uncle Trần Thủ Độ orchestrated the overthrow of the Lý dynasty. The Trần dynasty defeated three Mongol invasions, most notably during the decisive Battle of Bạch Đằng River in 1288. During its final decades, several succession crises and invasions from Champa severely weakened the dynasty. In 1398, emperor Trần Thuận Tông was forced to cede the throne to his three-year-old son Thiếu Đế, who in turn was forced to abdicate in 1400 in favor of the minister Hồ Quý Ly.
>
> The Trần improved Chinese gunpowder, enabling them to expand southward to defeat and vassalize the Champa. They also started using paper money for the first time in Vietnam. The period was considered a golden age in Vietnamese language, arts, and culture. The first pieces of Chữ Nôm literature were written during this period, while the introduction of vernacular Vietnamese into the court was established, alongside Literary Chinese. This laid the foundation for the further development and solidifying of the Vietnamese language and identity.
